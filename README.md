Aim assist bo2 compiled script

GSC script for plutonium to have a great aim assist for controller.  
Compiled from the provided source.  
Drag the script(.gsc file) into /appdata/local/plutonium/storage/t6/scripts/zm/  
(You can use it for mp as well but I wouldn't see why you want to as you can only use the script when hosting.)   

AIM.gsc (aims towards body(spine))  
AIM-head.gsc (aims towards head)  
AIM-neck.gsc (aims towards neck)
